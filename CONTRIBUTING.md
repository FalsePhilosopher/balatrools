# Contributing

Here's some basic guidelines and rules for contributions:

## Rules

1. All contributions must be in english, with the exception of translations of the website
2. Please make sure you look at the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cAbXMwQ4sz) #contributing to see if someone is already fixing/adding what you are making, including myself
3. If you are ADDING a feature, please make sure you let me know in #contributing BEFORE starting to make your changes, as I may already be working on said feature or I will work on it in the future.

## Guidelines

1. Prefer using components in the `src/components` directory such as `Button`, `Input`, etc.
2. Use ESLint or builds will fail
3. Comments are optional basically everywhere, funny comments are fine, use comments on code that makes no sense at first glance
4. Your PR should be VERY descriptive of all changes. Please include screenshots as well.
5. Be open to code review when you make your PR!

## Use of AI

Balatrools is made without the use of generative AI, especially media. If you are going to contribute, please do not include any AI generated assets/text. Any pull requests with AI-generated code/media/text will be denied and you will possibly be blocked from contributing in the future.

You may use basic AI tools like GitHub Copilot/Cursor/etc. but please do not have it generate giant blocks of code without throughly reviewing it and making sure it works exactly as intended. You should still know how the block of code works as if you wrote it.
